Titanic Data

"The Titanic was thought to be the most luxurious and safest ship of its time, generating legends that were supposedly "unsinkable"." 
The voyage that culminated in the sinking of the RMS Titanic began in Southampton / United Kingdom on 10/04/1912, passing through Cherbourg-Octeville / France and Queenstown / Ireland. On April 14 he collided with an iceberg and sank, the next morning, with another 1500 people on board.
A curious fact, which may have helped us in our analysis of data, was that during the evacuation of the passengers Captain Smith went to two officers (Lightoller and Murdoch) and said, "put the women and children and lower them." The two interpreted the order differently, and Ligthtoller understood that they could only board women and children, and when there was no one in that group, he would throw the empty boats. Murdoch allowed men to board after women and children. Because they did not know the total number of people the boat held, several were thrown at half their capacity unused.

Questions that will guide the analysis:
Knowing that there was this misunderstanding in the distribution of passengers by boat, the data source titanic.cvs provides us with some information that reflects this misunderstanding among the officers?
Women and children had a better chance of surviving?
Was the class an important factor for survival?
And the question I ask myself is if I were there, woman, young adult, in the 2nd class is it likely that I would have survived?

Curious? Let's start analyzing the data!
